        <dt class="first">What is this?</dt>
        <dd>Wedding Crunchers lets you search for specific phrases over 30+ years of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/pages/fashion/weddings/index.html" target="_blank">New York Times wedding announcements</a>. When you search for a phrase, Wedding Crunchers graphs how common that phrase has been over time. The project was heavily inspired by the <a href="http://books.google.com/ngrams" target="_blank">Google Books Ngram Viewer</a></dd>

        <dt>I love it! Where can I read more about it?</dt>
        <dd>There's a detailed writeup on <%= link_to "Rap Genius", writeup_url, :target => "_blank" %>, of course</dd>

        <dt>How many articles are searched?</dt>
        <dd>About 60,000 wedding and engagement announcements, from 1981 through today. Articles that are part of the <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/features/style/fashionandstyle/columns/vows/index.html" target="_blank">Vows column</a> are specifically excluded, because they are written in a very different style from the regular announcements</dd>

        <dt>What about punctuation and case sensitivity?</dt>
        <dd>Unlike the Google Ngram Viewer, Wedding Crunchers is <em>not</em> case sensitive. Most punctuation is stripped out for you automatically, so you don't have to worry about it. Ampersands (<code>&</code>) are not stripped out, so include them if you're looking for law firms!</dd>

        <dt>Any other cool features?</dt>
        <dd>Sure, if you want to get fancy, you can use <code>+</code> and <code>/</code> to build advanced searches. Check out some of the recommended searches for examples</dd>

        <dt>Where can I learn more about ngrams?</dt>
        <dd><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> and the <a href="http://books.google.com/ngrams/info" target="_blank">Google Books Ngram Viewer</a> are good places to start</dd>
